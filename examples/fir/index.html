        <h1>Finite Impulse Response Filter.</h1>
        <p>Computes the convolution of an input sequence with a finite set of coefficients.</p>
        <p>The design may be generated with no pipelining, or very aggressive pipelining.
        This is seen in the simulation waveforms as a delay before the results are computed.</p>
