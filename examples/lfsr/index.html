        <h1>Linear feedback shift register</h1>
        <p>A LFSR can be used to compute a psueodo-random sequence of numbers.  For a given width $N$, the sequence has length $2^N-1$, and repeats.</p>
        <p>If the circuit is built using XOR gates, the all zeros value is unreachable.  If built using XNOR gates, the all ones value is unreachable.</p>
        <p>The generator supports widths from 2 to 168 bits.  A suitable set of taps is automatically chosen.  A related counterpart set of taps may be selected.</p>
        <p>The LFSR architecture may be built using either Galois or Fibonacci form.  Generally one prefers the former as it is very slightely more efficient.</p>
        <p>As can be seen in the simulations, the architecture, gate selection and counterpart tap selection each lead to different sequences.</p>
