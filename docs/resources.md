## Zprize

Our submission to the ZPrize competition which won first place in the Multi-scalar Multiplication
track, and second place in the Number Theoretic Transform track.

Our [website](https://zprize.hardcaml.com) describes what we built, and you can grab our open
source code from [Github](https://github.com/fyquah/hardcaml_zprize)

## MIP CPU Blog

A couple of students from Penn State university decided to try and build a MIPs CPU
using Hardcaml.

They documented their journey in an excellent series of
[blogs](https://ceramichacker.com/blog/1-1x-hardcaml-mips-intro-what-and-why)
and provide their code on
[Github](https://github.com/askvortsov1/hardcaml-mips).

## Reedsolomon

Reed-Solomon is a classic error correction CODEC.  This
[library](https://github.com/hardcamls/reedsolomon) provides a highly configurable
encoder and decoder in Hardcaml.

<!--
The related website provides interactive calculations showing how Reed-Solomon
work.

XXX When an if I develop it...

## Other Notable Projects

- [CHIP-8](https://github.com/jawline/c8hardcaml) in Hardcaml with cool visual tests.
- [Layer-4 Load Balancer](https://github.com/xThaid/fpga-lb) using Hardcaml for the
  dataplane.
